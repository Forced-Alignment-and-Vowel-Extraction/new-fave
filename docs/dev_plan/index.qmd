## What is FAVEy about this?

### Why not just use fasttrackpy on all data?

The plan is for new-fave to be more opinionated about the input data stucture. fasttrackpy is more general purpose and therefore has its own design approach.

### What is new-fave going to offer?

The plan is for new-fave to bring together, under one tool

- `fave-recode`ing of input data, allowing for dialect, language, or research question specific recoding of alignment output
- Customizable point measurement heuristics
- Enriched data output enabled by its opinionated approach to data input. (e.g. `fave-syllabify`)

### What will new-fave contribute to the *analysis*?
