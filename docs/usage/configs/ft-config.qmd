title: FastTrack Config
---

For more details on how to configure FastTrack, see [the fasttrackpy documentation](https://fasttrackiverse.github.io/fasttrackpy/usage/getting_started.html). Any fasttrackpy config file can be passed to a fave-extract subcommand.

For example, if you wanted to adjust the range of max-formants considered by fasttrack, you could create a config file like so:

``` yaml
# fasttrack.yml
min_max_formant: 3000
max_max_formant: 6000
```

Then you would pass this the â€“ft-config option.

``` bash
# command-line
fave-extract corpus my_corpus \
    --ft-config fasttrack.yml
```
